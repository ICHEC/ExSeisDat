Testing:
To run tests from scratch, cd into the test folder and run
    ./genfiles
to generate the test data, then run
    ./spectests
to run all the tests. For future tests, just run the spectests executable.

Time Sinks:
Google Mock has limitations when it comes to death tests.  Do not expect mock
expectations to be handled correctly in a death test as the newly spawned
threads appear to play havok with the correct deallocation of the mock.

Heavy unit tests include the "Farm" keyword. Run
    ./spectests --gtest_filter=-*Farm*
to skip all the heavy unit tests that should be task farmed.
