<h1>ExSeisPIOL C++ Style Guide</h1>
<div class="horizontal_toc" id="tocDiv"></div>
<div class="main_body"> 

<h2 class="ignoreLink" id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>C++ is one of the main development languages used by
many of Google's open-source projects and has been adopted by the ExSeisPIOL
Project. As every C++ programmer knows, the language has many powerful features,
but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make
code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.</p>
<p>The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by
describing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code.
These rules exist to
keep  the code base manageable while still allowing
coders to use C++ language features productively.</p>
<p><em>Style</em>, also known as readability, is what we call
the conventions that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a
bit of a misnomer, since these conventions cover far more than
just source file formatting.</p>
<p>
Most open-source projects developed by
Google conform to the requirements in this guide and we have adopted the 
google style guide. This document is a summary of that style guide (and thus a derived
work available under the same license).
</p>

<p>Much of the style guide is captured by the following example:
<pre>
namespace PIOL { namespace File {
enum class Hdr : size_t
{
    Increment = 3217U,   //Short in the SEG-Y standard
    NumSample = 3221U,   //Short in the SEG-Y standard
    Type = 3225U         //Short, Trace data type. AKA format in SEGY terminology
};

template <typename T = short>
T getHostShort(const uchar * src)
{
    return (T(src[0]) << 8) | T(src[1]);
}

template <class T = int>
T getMd(Hdr val, const uchar * buf)
{
    switch (val)
    {  
        case Hdr::Increment :
        case Hdr::Type :
        case Hdr::NumSample :
        return getHostShort(&buf[size_t(val)-1]);
        default :
        return 0;
        break;
    }
}
}}
</pre></p>

<h2 id="Header_Files">Header Files</h2>
<p>In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an
associated <code>.hh</code> file. There are some common
exceptions, such as  unittests.</p>
<p>Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to
the readability, size and performance of your code.</p>
<p>The following rules will guide you through the various
pitfalls of using header files.</p>
<a id="The_-inl.h_Files"></a>
<h3 id="Self_contained_Headers">Self-contained Headers</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and
end in <code>.h</code>. Non-header files that are meant for inclusion
should end in <code>.inc</code>. </p>
</div>
<div class="stylebody">
<p>All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring
tools should not have to adhere to special conditions to include the
header. Specifically, a header should
have <a href="#The__define_Guard">header guards</a> and include all
other headers it needs.</p>
<p>If a template or inline function is declared in a <code>.h</code>
file, that same header should provide its definition. The definitions
of these constructs must be included into every <code>.cc</code> file
that uses them, or the program may fail to link in some build
configurations. Do not move these definitions to separately included
header files (<code>-inl.h</code>).</p>
<p>As an exception, a template that is explicitly instantiated for
all relevant sets of template arguments, or that is a private
implementation detail of a class, is allowed to be defined in the one
and only <code>.cc</code> file that instantiates the template.</p>
<p>There are rare cases where a file is not meant to be
self-contained, but it is meant to be included at a specific point in
the code.  Examples are files that need to be included multiple times
or platform-specific implementation details that are essentially part
of other self-contained headers. Such files should use the file
extension <code>.inc</code>.</p>
</div> 
<h3 id="The__define_Guard">The #define Guard</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to
prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the symbol name
should be
<code><i>&lt;PIOL&gt;</i><i>&lt;PATH&gt;</i><i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>_INCLUDE_GUARD</code>.</p>
</div> 
<h3 id="Forward_Declarations">Forward Declarations</h3>
<div class="summary">
  <p>Avoid using forward declarations where possible.
  Just <code>#include</code> the headers you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="stylebody">
<div class="definition">
<p>A "forward declaration" is a declaration of a class,
function, or template without an associated definition.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to avoid forward declarations of entities
  defined in another project.</li>
  <li>When using a function declared in a header file,
  always <code>#include</code> that header.</li>
  <li>When using a class template, prefer to
  <code>#include</code> its header file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="#Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order
of Includes</a> for rules about when to #include a header.</p>
</div>
</div> 
<h3 id="Inline_Functions">Inline Functions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 5
lines or fewer.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order of Includes</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden
dependencies: Related header, C library, C++ library,  other libraries'
<code>.h/.hh</code>, your project's <code>.hh</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stylebody">
<p>

<h2 id="Scoping">Scoping</h2>
<h3 id="Namespaces">Namespaces</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Namespaces
should have unique names and be defined in the architecture document.
Unnamed namespaces in <code>.cc</code> files are encouraged if there is no applicable
namespace. Do not use <i>using-directives</i> (e.g.
<code>using namespace foo</code>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="Nonmember,_Static_Member,_and_Global_Functions">Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global
functions rarely. Prefer grouping functions with a namespace instead of
using a class as if it were a namespace. Static methods of a class should
generally be closely related to instances of the class or the class's static
data.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Local_Variables">Local Variables</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope
possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Static_and_Global_Variables">Static and Global Variables</h3>
<div class="summary">
  <p>Variables of class type with <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Storage_duration">
    static storage duration</a> are forbidden: they cause hard-to-find bugs due
  to indeterminate order of construction and destruction. However, such
  variables are allowed if they are <code>constexpr</code>: they have no
  dynamic initialization or destruction.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Classes">Classes</h2>
<p>Classes are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally,
we use them extensively. This section lists the main dos and
don'ts you should follow when writing a class.</p>
<h3 id="Doing_Work_in_Constructors">Doing Work in Constructors</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Avoid virtual method calls in constructors, and avoid
initialization that can fail if you can't signal an error.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Implicit_Conversions">Implicit Conversions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Do not define implicit conversions. Use the <code>explicit</code>
keyword for conversion operators and single-argument
constructors.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Copyable_Movable_Types">Copyable and Movable Types</h3>
<a id="Copy_Constructors"></a>
<div class="summary">
<p>Support copying and/or moving if these operations are clear and meaningful
for your type. Otherwise, disable the implicitly generated special functions
that perform copies and moves.
</p></div>

<h3 id="Structs_vs._Classes">Structs vs. Classes</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that
      carry data; everything else is a <code>class</code>.</p>

<div class="summary">
<p>Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance.
When using inheritance, make it <code>public</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Multiple_Inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Only very rarely is multiple implementation inheritance
actually useful. We allow multiple inheritance only when at
most one of the base classes has an implementation; all
other base classes must be <a href="#Interfaces">pure
interface</a> classes tagged with the
<code>Interface</code> suffix.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Interfaces">Interfaces</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Classes that satisfy certain conditions are allowed, but
not required, to end with an <code>Interface</code> suffix.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Operator_Overloading">Operator Overloading</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Overload operators judiciously. Do not create user-defined literals.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Access_Control">Access Control</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p> Make data members <code>private</code>, unless they are
<code>static const</code> (and follow the <a href="#Constant_Names">
naming convention for constants</a>). For technical
reasons, we allow data members of a test fixture class to
be <code>protected</code> when using
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google
Test</a>).</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Declaration_Order">Declaration Order</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p> Use the specified order of declarations within a class:
<code>public:</code> before <code>private:</code>, methods
before data members (variables), etc.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>
<h3 id="Function_Parameter_Ordering">Parameter Ordering</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>When defining a function, parameter order is: inputs, then
outputs.</p>

<h3 id="Write_Short_Functions">Write Short Functions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Prefer small and focused functions.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Reference_Arguments">Reference Arguments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>All parameters passed by reference must be labeled
<code>const</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Function_Overloading">Function Overloading</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use overloaded functions (including constructors) only if a
reader looking at a call site can get a good idea of what
is happening without having to first figure out exactly
which overload is being called.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Default_Arguments">Default Arguments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Default arguments are allowed on non-virtual functions
when the default is guaranteed to always have the same
value. Follow the same restrictions as for <a href="#Function_Overloading">function overloading</a>, and
prefer overloaded functions if the readability gained with
default arguments doesn't outweigh the downsides below.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="trailing_return">Trailing Return Type Syntax</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use trailing return types only where using the ordinary syntax (leading
  return types) is impractical or much less readable.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Ownership_and_Smart_Pointers">Ownership and Smart Pointers</h3>

<p>Prefer to have single, fixed owners for dynamically
allocated objects. Prefer to transfer ownership with smart

to detect style errors.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Other_C++_Features">Other C++ Features</h2>
<h3 id="Rvalue_references">Rvalue References</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use rvalue references only to define move constructors and move assignment
operators, or for perfect forwarding.
</p>

<div class="summary">
<p>We allow use of <code>friend</code> classes and functions,
within reason.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>We do not use C++ exceptions.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Run-Time_Type_Information__RTTI_">Run-Time Type

<p>Avoid using Run Time Type Information (RTTI) except when delegating object construction within another constructor.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Casting">Casting</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use C++-style casts
like <code>static_cast&lt;float&gt;(double_value)</code>, or brace
initialization for conversion of arithmetic types like
<code>int64 y = int64{1} &lt;&lt; 42</code>. Do not use
cast formats like
<code>int y = (int)x</code> or <code>int y = int(x)</code> (but the latter
is okay when invoking a constructor of a class type).</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Streams">Streams</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use streams where appropriate, and stick to "simple"
usages. Use the C File API for complex non-parallel file output.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Preincrement_and_Predecrement">Preincrement and Predecrement</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use prefix form (<code>++i</code>) of the increment and
decrement operators with iterators and other template
objects.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Use_of_const">Use of const</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense. With C++11,
<code>constexpr</code> is a better choice for some uses of
const. The code follows the principle of least privilege in the declaration function parameters</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Use_of_constexpr">Use of constexpr</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>In C++11, use <code>constexpr</code> to define true
constants or to ensure constant initialization.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Integer_Types">Integer Types</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>If your variable represents a value that could ever be greater
than or equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as <code>int64_t</code>.
A typedef llint is provided in global.hh for this purpose.
Keep in mind that even if your value won't ever be too large
for an <code>int</code>, it may be used in intermediate
calculations which may require a larger type. When in doubt,
choose a larger type.</p>
Use size_t to refer to sizes of objects.
</div>

<h3 id="64-bit_Portability">64-bit Code</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>We only target 64-bit.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Preprocessor_Macros">Preprocessor Macros</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Be very cautious with macros. Prefer inline and constexpr functions,
enums, and <code>const</code> variables to macros. Don't
use macros to define pieces of a C++ API.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="auto">auto</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use <code>auto</code> to avoid type names that are noisy, obvious,
or unimportant - cases where the type doesn't aid in clarity for the
reader. Continue to use manifest type declarations when it helps
readability. Auto should not be used for function return types except
where those functions are static and used "nearby".</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Braced_Initializer_List">Braced Initializer List</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>You may use braced initializer lists.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Lambda_expressions">Lambda expressions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use lambda expressions where appropriate. Prefer explicit captures
when the lambda will escape the current scope.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Template_metaprogramming">Template metaprogramming</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Avoid complicated template programming.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Boost">Boost</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Do not use Boost. We want to minimise dependencies on other libraries</p>
</div>

<h3 id="C++11">C++14</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use libraries and language extensions from C++14 when appropriate. Test
features compile with both the Intel and GNU compilers. Both Tullow and ICHEC systems
have the capacity to support C++14 features. </p>
</div>

<h3 id="Nonstandard_Extensions">Nonstandard Extensions</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Nonstandard extensions to C++ may not be used unless otherwise specified. If
a non-standard feature is used the code must also be able to compile with strict flags
and with the same functionality. </p>
</div>

<h3 id="Aliases">Aliases</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Public aliases are for the benefit of the API's user, and should be clearly documented.</p>
<p>Don't put an alias in the end-user API just to save typing in the implementation;
  do so only if you intend it to be used by our clients.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Naming">Naming</h2>
<p>The most important consistency rules are those that govern
naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our
brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.
</p>
<p>Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but
 we feel that
consistency is more important than individual preferences in this
area, so regardless of whether you find them sensible or not,
the rules are the rules.</p>
<h3 id="General_Naming_Rules">General Naming Rules</h3>
<div class="summary">

<h3 id="File_Names">File Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Filenames should be all lowercase. Do not use underscores (<code>_</code>)
or dashes (<code>-</code>) in file names.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Type_Names">Type Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Type names use upper CamelCase.</p>

<h3 id="Variable_Names">Variable Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>The names of variables and data members use lower camelCase. Data parameters
for class/struct constructors have trailing underscores where there is a member
variable of the same name.
<p>C style abbreviations such as in the style of the POSIX API (e.g msg and src) are allowed.</p>

<div class="stylebody">
<h3 id="Function_Names">Function Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Function names should be descriptive; avoid acronyms unless the abbreviation is defined in deliverables or 
the architecture/end user documentaton.</p>
</div>
<p>Functions names use lower camelCase. e.g readDataFile.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Namespace_Names">Namespace Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
Namespace names begin with a capital and should be a single word or acronym. Acronyms are all capitalised. There is currently one Top-level namespace for the
project: PIOL.
</div>
</div>

<div class="summary">
<p>Enumerators should be named in upper CamelCase.</p>

define a macro</a> When you write a macro, they are like this:
<code>MY_MACRO_THAT_SCARES_SMALL_CHILDREN</code>. <h3 id="Macro_Names">Macro Names</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>You're not really going to <a href="#Preprocessor_Macros">
define a macro</a>, are you? If you do, they're like this:
<code>MY_MACRO_THAT_SCARES_SMALL_CHILDREN</code>. Hash defines
follow the same style.</p>
</div></p>
</div>

<h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Though a pain to write, comments are absolutely vital to
keeping our code readable. The following rules describe what
you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are
very important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving
sensible names to types and variables is much better than using
obscure names that you must then explain through comments.</p>
<p>When writing your comments, write for your audience: the
reviewer. Be generous &#8212; you are also a reviewer!</p>

<h3 id="Comment_Style">Comment Style</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use either <code>//</code> for short comments and <code>/* */</code>
for longer comments. Use <code>/* */</code> for doxygen struct, class, function
comments. Use <code>//</code> for inline doxygen comments. </p>
</div>

<h3 id="File_Comments">File Comments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Start each file with license boilerplate etc.</p>
<p>File comments describe the contents of a file. If a file declares,
implements, or tests exactly one abstraction that is documented by a comment
at the point of declaration, file comments are not required. All other files
should have file comments. If you are creating a file, add the file comment boilerplate
and also the <code>\author</code> command noting the initial author. Copy the header style of 
other files. This includes the other of files. </p>
</div>

<h3 id="Function_Comments">Function Comments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Declaration comments describe use of the function (when it is
non-obvious) and must use doxygen; comments at the definition of a
function describe operation.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Implementation_Comments">Implementation Comments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>In your implementation you should have comments in tricky,
non-obvious, interesting, or important parts of your code.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Punctuation,_Spelling_and_Grammar">Punctuation, Spelling and Grammar</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is
easier to read well-written comments than badly written
ones.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="TODO_Comments">TODO Comments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Use <code>TODO</code> comments for code that is temporary,
a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect. Larger TODO's should be in doxygen
syntax.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Deprecation_Comments">Deprecation Comments</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Mark deprecated interface points with <code>[[deprecated]]</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Line_Length">Line Length</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Each line of text in your code should be at most about 140
characters long and preferably about ~100 characters. Text comments should have line breaks after about eac ~100 characters to aide reading. </p>
</div>

<h3 id="Non-ASCII_Characters">Non-ASCII Characters</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Non-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8
formatting.</p>
    code>u8"\uFEFF"</code>, is the Unicode zero-width
no-break space character, which would be invisible if
included in the source as straight UTF-8.</p>
<p>Use the <code>u8</code> prefix
to guarantee that a string literal containing
<code>\uXXXX</code> escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8.
Do not use it for strings containing non-ASCII characters
encoded as UTF-8, because that will produce incorrect
output if the compiler does not interpret the source file
as UTF-8. </p>
<p>You shouldn't use the C++11 <code>char16_t</code> and
<code>char32_t</code> character types, since they're for
non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn't
use <code>wchar_t</code> (unless you're writing code that
interacts with the Windows API, which uses
<code>wchar_t</code> extensively).</p>

other considerations, use the minimum number of lines.</p>

<div class="summary">
<p>Format a <a href="#Braced_Initializer_List">braced initializer list</a>

<p>Do not use redundant parantheses unless it aids code readability.</p>

<h3 id="Conditionals">Curly braces</h3>
<p>For conditions, classes, switch, for, while, do structures, namespaces,
enums and functions etc, curly braces should be on a separate line and
indented up to the level of the current scope. Curly braces should be the
only non-space character on the line</p>
<p>There are three exceptions: initialiser lists and lambda functions should have a curly brace 
on the same line as the object declaration and empty braces can be on the 
same line as the previous statement.</p>
<p>If a curly brace is optional it should not be used.</p>
